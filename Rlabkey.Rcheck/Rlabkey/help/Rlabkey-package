     This package allows the transfer of data between a labkey database
     and an R session. Data can be imported from  a labkey database
     into R by specifying the query schema information
     ('labkey.selectRows')  or by using sql commands
     ('labkey.executeSql'). From an R session, existing data can be
     updated ('labkey.updateRows'), new data can be inserted
     ('labkey.insertRows') or   data can be deleted from the labkey
     database ('labkey.deleteRows'). 

     The user must have the appropriate authorization on the labkey
     server in order to modify the database through the use of these
     functions.

       Package:   Rlabkey
       Type:      Package
       Version:   0.0.4

     Using this package to access a password protected labkey data base
     requires that the user has their login information in a netrc
     file. The netrc file contains configuration and autologin
     information for the File Transfer Protocol client (ftp) and other
     programs such as CURL.

     On a UNIX system this file should be named .netrc (dot netrc) and
     on windows it sould be  named _netrc (underscore netrc). The file
     should be located in the users home directory and the  permissions
     on the file should be unreadable for everybody except the owner.  

     To create the _netrc on a windows machine, first create an
     environment variable called 'HOME' that  is set to your home
     directory (c:/Users/<User-Name> on Vista) or any directory you
     want to use.  In that directory, create a text file named _netrc
     (note that it's underscore netrc, not dot  netrc like it is on
     UNIX). 

     The following three lines must be included in the .netrc or _netrc
     file either separated by white space (spaces, tabs, or newlines)
     or commas.

     machine <remote-machine-name>
      login <user-email>
      password <user-password>

     One example would be:
      machine atlas.scharp.org
      login vobencha@fhcrc.org
      password mypassword

     Another example would be:
      machine atlas.scharp.org login vobencha@fhcrc.org password
     mypassword
